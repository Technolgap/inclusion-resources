# Harvey Mudd College statistics

➔   Increase in female faculty and students (1996 to 2016)

|          | 1996 | 2006 | 2016 |
|----------|------|------|------|
| faculty  | ~20% | ~30% | ~40% |
| students | ~20% | ~30% | ~50% |

➔   Change in racial diversity over last 7 years

* White: 54.08% (2012-13)

* White: 30.61% (2019-20)

➔   What catalyzed change?

* **Strategic planning** in 2006 and diversity and **inclusion programming** for everyone



# Female Enrolment in Computer Science

➔   Problem of assuming women/poc aren’t interested in stem. This is not the problem.

➔   Women tend to doubt their abilities more than men. Women who fail or get a bad mark earlier on in their degree are more likely to switch majors. When there’s only a small percentage of women in the program, you feel that you have to be doing incredibly well to stick with it. If there were lots of women, more of them would feel more comfortable getting a lower mark (etc. C) and staying.

* Women feel less competent than men unless they’re showing exceedingly above average results

 

# Increase in faculty racial diversity

➔   Much slower

* Rate of turnover is a lot slower for racial equity in faculty. Students stay for 4 years and are replaced whereas faculty stay for 30 years

➔   Fairly steady progress, when attention slips progress disappears

➔   Critically important to **educate search committees**

* Lots of unintentional bias, very easy for employers to hire other people who look like them

 

# Key changes throughout community

➔   Admission materials, programs

➔   Curriculum and pedagogy

* Studies show there is a greater chance of attracting women/poc into disciplines if introductory courses includes applications and show theories that can be served to **solve real world problems**

* Women, more often than men, say they want to become socially responsible engineers

* Add more support in intro courses

* Removing unintentional privilege and bias

➔   Imagery (website, magazine, pictures, brochures)

* Important to **showcase a diverse community** in any brochure or website

* Showing diversity can be a step toward creating a more diverse campus. It helps students imagine themselves at those schools

➔   Access to early internships and research

* Work with major tech companies to start early internship programs.

* Google, Intel, etc. establish early internship programs where they deliberately try to focus on hiring women and poc.

* If we can give them those early experiences, they are more likely to stay in the program and graduate

➔   Access to diverse role models

➔   Education of faculty search committees

* People make mistakes unintentionally but they won't make it if you have the opportunity to educate them.

➔   Co-curricular activities

➔   Board composition (50% alum, 20% parents, 30% other)

 

# What the CS department did

➔   Changed the intro course

* Old course: learning to program in Java

* New course: term-based creative problem-solving to science and engineering using computational approaches in Python

* Python is a language that is more forgiving to syntax and is also widely used in the industry. This will get students to increase their chances of getting  internships after first year.

* Grouping by prior experience:

    * CS 5 gold (no experience in programming), CS 5 black (a few courses in high school), CS 42 (programming from a very young age)

    * Students can switch between levels if they feel one level is too easy or difficult
    
    * Helps **eliminate macho behaviour** (students who answer and ask all questions)

➔   Eliminate student macho behaviour

* Take students aside and have an encouraging conversation with students talking too much in class. Ask them to meet in office hours instead to have these great conversations. Use TAs to do this in larger classes

* Students who answer every question and ask several questions each class can intimidate other students and cause them to feel as if they’re inadequate or don’t know enough. Macho students typically aren’t aware that they are intimidating the other students.

* Because these people are answering and questioning so much, a lot of students think they don't know as much compared to the class

➔   Took first year females to Hopper

* Then students of color to Tapia

* Take students to these conferences because it exposes them to role models

➔   Provided summer research experiences between first and second year

* Then industry internships

➔   Recruited more faculty of color and women

* Increases access to diverse role models. It is important to have women of color/poc on the school’s faculty.

* If not, it would be a great idea to bring in guest speakers who can fill these roles

 

# Insights for grad programs

➔   Exposure to research as an undergrad increases interest in grad school

➔   Recruiting tips

* Stress creativity, collaboration and communication as well as technical skill sand knowledge

➔   Interview process

* Ensure candidates meet diverse students and faculty

    * Often when talking to members of underrepresented populations and asking for their perspective, they complain about going to an interview or place and only meeting 1 other poc or woman

* Train hosts on diversity and inclusion

➔   Build confidence and community among groups

➔   Demystify path to success

 

 

# Insights for training faculty

➔   Educate search committees on avoiding bias, how to attract diverse candidates, how to interview diverse candidates successfully

* If you ask people to suggest good candidates, they end up mostly suggesting white and Asian males through unintentional bias. Ask them to provide separate statements (etc. good candidates who are women, poc). They almost always are able to think of one.

➔   Ask candidates to **provide separate statements** on teaching, research, and diversity/inclusion

➔   Ensure candidates meet with diverse groups of students, faculty, and diversity leaders
